# Wordle Starting Word Selector (WSWS)

Wordle Starting Word Selector (WSWS) is an application that attempts to generate a good random starting word to use with [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). It has limited pratical use but... why not?

**Credit:** The dictionary used for this example is taken from the man, the legend, Mr Josh Wardle himself. The source for this dictionary used to be from one of his [GitHub Repo's](https://github.com/powerlanguage/word-lists/blob/master/word-list-raw.txt) but this either wasn't used or has diverged. Instead I have now pulled the dictionary directly from the javascript of the [Wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) itself.
